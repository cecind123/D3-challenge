In this assignment, I analyze the current trends between poverty and healthcare using census data provided in a CSV. I create charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help understand the findings.

I use HTML, CSS, JS, and d3.js to create a Healthcare vs. Poverty scatter plot with a tooltip that displays pertinent information at each point on the plot. 

In order to view the scatter plot, please visit my github.io: https://cecind123.github.io/D3-challenge/D3_data_journalism/index.html
